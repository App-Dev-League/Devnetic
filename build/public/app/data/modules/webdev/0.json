Most IDEs have three major components:\r\n- The code editor. This is what you'll be spending most of our time in, and, like the name suggests, is the place where you actually write code.\r\n\r\n- The compiler/builder. This is a piece of code that turns your code into something machines can actually understand. \r\n\r\n- The debugger. This is a program that allows you to debug your code. If something's not running as expected, you'll want to open this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Different IDEs\r\nIf you're new to software development, we highly recommend [Replit](https://replit.com/), a full development platform that's hosted in the cloud! It's completely free to use, and allows you to edit and run code from anywhere with an internet connection.\r\n\r\nDevnetic also has an IDE!
