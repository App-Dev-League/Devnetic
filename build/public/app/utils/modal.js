Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.","When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important.","It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success.","There is no failure except in no longer trying.","I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.","Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.","There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure","Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.","Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.","I'd rather be partly great than entirely useless.","We are all failures - at least the best of us are","The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.","Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.","Winners are not afraid of losing.

We speak about success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success. I've met people who don't want to try for fear of failing.","No human ever became interesting by not failing. The more you fail and recover and improve, the better you are as a person. Ever meet someone who's always had everything work out for them with zero struggle? They usually have the depth of a puddle. Or they don't exist.","When we give ourselves permission to fail, we, at the same time, give ourselves permission to excel.","With a hint of good judgment, to fear nothing, not failure or suffering or even death, indicates that you value life the most. You live to the extreme; you push limits; you spend your time building legacies.
